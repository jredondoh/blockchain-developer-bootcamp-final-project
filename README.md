To have a way of sharing a property of a NFT between several friends.

The user selects the NFT to purchase.

The user specifies if the NFT property is shared.

The different property percentage can be sold/transferred or split even more.

Having different media not only visual art.
Implementing some kind of anti-theft tool to avoid the copy of the NFT visual art as a digital file.
