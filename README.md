# NFTs shared with friends

## Initial description and goals

### Description:

To have a way of sharing a property of a NFT between several friends.

### Workflow:

The user will have to register themselves in the NFT marketplace.

The user selects the NFT to purchase.

The user specifies if the NFT property is shared.

If shared, the user specifies the different property percentages and the addresses of the different owners.

### Strech goal:

The different property percentage can be sold/transferred or split even more.
